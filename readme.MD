-   MySQL Community Server
-   MySQL Workbench

After installing MySQL Community Server you should have MySQL CLC (Command Line Client) available

To start/stop the server `mysql.server start` `mysql.server stop`

-   Once the server has spined up you're machine will be ready to establish connections between clients and the DB.

-   This means that any application with the right credentials will be able to access and modify data in the databases registered inside your local MySQL instance
